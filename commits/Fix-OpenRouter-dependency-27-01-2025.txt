Fix: Add missing @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider dependency and update API usage

## Changes
- Added @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider v0.7.2 to package.json dependencies
- Updated OpenRouter client imports from OpenRouter to createOpenRouter
- Removed deprecated baseURL parameter (now built into the new API)

## Issue Fixed
Vercel deployment was failing with error:
"Cannot find module '@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider' or its corresponding type declarations"

## Files Modified
- apps/web/package.json: Added dependency
- apps/web/src/integrations/openrouter/client.ts: Updated API usage

## Testing

✅ No more import errors locally
